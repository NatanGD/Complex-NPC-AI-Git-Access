Thanks for trying out the Complex AI System!

Built with Unity 2021.3.11f1



This is a developer tool meant for creating complex NPC behaviour in a pub/restaurant setting. You can change the max number of NPCs present, the frequency they perform their actions and how quickly they leave the premises by configuring the settings. They have multiple personality traits which manipulate their behaviours, for example alcohol increases confidence and confidence is for instance used to determine where an NPC will sit at a table. The tool also provides access to the environment's appearance and each object's affect on the NPCs. For ways to edit these and other important details, please see below.





There are 2 example scenes to assist you getting familiar with the system and a simple set-up prefab that is ready to import into a scene. 

Scenes are found in:	Assets/Scenes/ExampleScenes
Prefab is found in:	Assets/Prefabs/Requisites/ConfiguredSetUp.prefab





IMPORTANT
-	Before using the tool, you need to build the nav mesh map. For information on how to do this, please read: 
				https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/nav-BuildingNavMesh.html

The example scenes have the nav mesh map built.

If you are experiencing issues withe NPCs not moving on spawn (even after baking the nav mesh), please restart Unity after saving your progress. This is a bug caused with the nav mesh.


All objects inside the prefabs can be changed to others, however, the object tags, scripts, colliders and other components should be kept the same. 

The following object names shouldn't be changed to avoid errors (there are name checks involved):
-	NPC
-	ManPoint and WomanPoint inside the toilet prefab

Due to the chair placement method, tables should only be rotated in 90-degree intervals. This is due to the way the Unity bounding boxes work as the width and length are dependant on the furthest x and z points. If rotated at other intervals it will create bounding boxes from the corners instead of the edges of the table.





Here are the potential customisations possible and how to perform them...
